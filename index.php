                        Our main product is multi-family residential property.   The multifamily rental housing market outperformed expectations in recent years and is expected to remain strong. Even with a significant increase in new supply delivered to the market in 2014, multifamily vacancy rates remained low and rent growth exceeded expectations.  Consistent with improving multifamily revenues, property price growth also advanced robustly in recent years. According to Real Capital Analytics (RCA), multifamily property values increased about 15 percent in 2014. Strong fundamentals and investor appetite for multifamily investments will propel further property appreciation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have limited our product to multi-family and our market to Sothern California, in order to better control the changes in fundamentals and better serve our clients.  Our outside the box approach in marketing multi-family properties can help clients to exceed the vale expectation.
